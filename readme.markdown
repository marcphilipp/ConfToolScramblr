# ConfToolScramblr

This little tool emerged while planning sessions for the [XP Days Germany 2011](http://www.xpdays.de/). Authors would submit their session proposols to [ConfTool](http://www.conftool.net/). Other users gave them feedback by reviewing and rating their sessions.

There are currently two use cases. First, automatic pre-selection of sessions from the proposals according to a set of criteria, e.g. highest rating. Second, generating wiki pages with title, abstract, and other information for the sessions that have been selected by the organizers in the end.
